Various practical scripts that I've written

## seb_ofx_to_msmoney.ps1
  Script for importing bank statements from SEB to MsMoney Sunset edition via OFX file format.
  Export your statement from SEB to a xlsx file - the script will run the macro in makro.xlsm 
  and then prepare the ofx-file for import.
  Still working in 2023 with SEB :-)
